The project has been researched, an improvement plan was recommended, and the next steps have been outlined and executed.

Here's a summary of the work done:

1.  **Project Research:** Analyzed the project structure, Zola configuration (`config.toml`), Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), `package.json`, and key templates (`base.html`, `index.html`, `blog.html`, `page.html`, `taxonomies.html`, `taxonomy.html`).
2.  **`txt_converter` Tool Enhancement:**
    *   Modified the Rust code to allow user input for post titles, tags, and categories.
    *   Improved error handling for file operations and user input.
    *   Documented the tool's features, usage, and example workflow in the `README.md`.
    *   Compiled the `txt_converter` tool using `cargo build --release`.
3.  **Dependency Updates:** Updated Tailwind CSS to the latest version using `npm install tailwindcss@latest`.
4.  **Content Review:** Reviewed existing content files (`.md`) for consistency in front matter and formatting.
5.  **Local Testing:**
    *   Ran the Zola development server (`zola serve`) and confirmed that the homepage, blog index, individual post pages, and taxonomy pages rendered correctly.
    *   Verified responsiveness and dark mode functionality.
    *   Tested the `txt_converter` tool, confirming successful conversion of `.txt` files to `.md` with proper front matter.
6.  **Static Site Build:** Successfully built the static site using `npm run build`, generating the `public/` directory with all necessary assets.
7.  **Next Steps Outline:** Provided a clear plan for further testing, content addition, and deployment verification.

The project is now well-researched, the custom tool is enhanced and documented, dependencies are updated, and the site has been tested locally. The next logical step would be to proceed with deployment verification and potentially adding more content.
